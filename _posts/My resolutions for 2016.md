As the euphoria of welcoming 2016 vade away post the new year eve, reality kicks in! 

Yet another new year right, Big Deal? Of course it is a big deal if we take it that way. So suddenly motivated with the posts 
from Mark Zuckerberg and other technology luminaries who i look up to, i thought i should think of resolutions which are most important to me and yet 
realistic to achieve.

A couple of resolutions like going to the gym more often and getting to work on time come to the mind, but then those are resolutions you take every year.

I thought those are essentials which have to be done and would need to take a resolution on a new year, so here are the one's i thought are
important to me and the one's i badly wanted to do!

1. Releasing the apps to the market by January end. We have been working on these for months and the D day keeps on getting moved. I will
now make sure i do release in beta no matter what by this month end.

2. 26 blog posts(that's 1 every 2 weeks) on the issues i feel concerned about, such as this:)

3. I love reading! Techcrunch, hacker news, the verge are the de facto websites i visit every day. But as people say, reading diverse genre
of books stimulate the mind and change our thoughts. So i am going to read at least 6 books over this year and post a review about the same.
